## Prerequisites

Getting Started
You need to have [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies `cd recipy-app` and run `npm install` in your terminal.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages. The pages auto-update as you edit the files.

## Code snippets
Here are some code that I found useful while developing the app:
